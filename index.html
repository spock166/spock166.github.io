<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I received a B.S. in mathematics in 2016 from Northwest Missouri State University (Go Bearcats!).  In 2022 I finished my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Kansas where I worked with <a href="https://jlmartin.ku.edu/"> Jeremy Martin</a> and I studied algebraic combinatorics.
